# Erlang MOOCs on FutureLearn, 2017

Exercise solutions for the courses

* [Functional Programming in Erlang](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/functional-programming-erlang), which started on 20 February 2017;
* [Concurrent Programming in Erlang](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/concurrent-programming-erlang), scheduled to start on 3 April 2017.

## Functional Programming in Erlang

* Step 1.05: [first.erl](first.erl) and [second.erl](second.erl).
* Step 1.15: Variable and pattern matching in practice:
    * [pattern.erl](pattern.erl);
    * see also:
        * [pattern.erl](https://github.com/nitkna/erlang-practise/blob/master/pattern.erl) by nitkna, which makes very effecient use of pattern matching.
        * [patterns.erl](https://gist.github.com/shakerlxxv/c4ce9ba760c68582da8c98b19b410cf1) by shakerlxxv, which includes unit tests with [EUnit](http://erlang.org/doc/apps/eunit/chapter.html).
        * [third.erl](https://gist.github.com/tejasbubane/624fec099d616dfaaa26dd2b14162821#file-third-erl) which uses `andalso` and `orelse`.
